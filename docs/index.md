Artemis is an art-sharing platform where the community can share and provide feedback on members' works. While unregistered users are limited to viewing posted artworks and searching for posts and users, they can opt to register to maximize the features of the app. Registered users can log in to post their art and showcase some of their selected works on their profile using the Highlights feature. Moreover, they can provide their feedback on other artworks posted in the community by giving an upvote or leaving a comment. <br/><br/>

Users also have the option to bookmark their favorite artworks made by other users so that they can view or return to them at a later time. Additionally, they can share posts on their Facebook accounts through its application programming interface (API). Users can search for a post by means of tags (e.g., “3D,” “watercolor,” and “pixel art”) and follow other users to see their posts in a dedicated section on their feed.
