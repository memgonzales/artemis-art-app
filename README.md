# Artemis
**Artemis** is an **art-sharing platform** where the community can share and provide feedback on members’ works. While unregistered users are limited to viewing posted artworks and searching for posts and users, they can opt to register to maximize the features of the app. Registered users can log in to post their art and showcase some of their selected works on their profile using the Highlights feature. Moreover, they can provide their feedback on other artworks posted in the community by giving an upvote or leaving a comment. 

Users also have the option to bookmark their favorite artworks made by other users so that they can view or return to them at a later time. Additionally, they can share posts on their Facebook accounts through its application programming interface (API). Users can search for a post by means of tags (e.g., “3D,” “watercolor,” and “pixel art”) and follow other users to see their posts in a dedicated section on their feed.

## Task
**Artemis** is the major course output in a mobile development class. The students are tasked to create an Android app of their choice, provided that it satisfied the minimum requirement of being connected to a remote server or featuring at least two of the following services: telephony, local database, geolocation, touch gestures that are non-native to the views used, camera usage, canvas or graphics-related applications, motion sensors, service that runs on the background, and usage of third-party APIs.

The application development is divided into two phases:

Phase | Duration | Description
-- | -- | --
1 (Beta Demo) | 2 weeks | Completion of front-end views or layouts for all the activities, and implementation of either at least one API feature or all the database helpers (however, only the schemas are needed for apps that use a remote database)
